# 8Ball plugin for Alphaid Bot

## Description

Magic 8 ball gives advice by replying to the questions that could be answered positive (“Yes - definitely”), neutrally (“Ask again later”) or negatively (“Don't count on it”). Like “Am I cool guy?” or “Will we meet tomorrow with that girl?”, “I should stay home?”.

You **should not rely** on these questions while seeking a real advice as they based on the random, but it is nice thing to joke around in the chat. Have fun instead.

Also, beware bot hosts: even that this thing powered by good random, it will hate you more than anybody else in the world. Don't be mad about it, it's just seeking attention and wants to seem cool by disrespecting you. And this is not even scripted, you can look in the source code.
